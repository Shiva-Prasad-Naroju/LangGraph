# 🤖 LangGraph Mini Projects – Learning Agentic Workflows Step by Step

This repository contains a complete set of **mini-projects** to master core concepts in **LangGraph** — a framework for building **stateful, agentic applications**.

Each project was implemented **immediately after learning** the concept, with real code, tools, and structured graphs. Perfect for anyone building production-grade GenAI systems like **Vaasthu Vision AI**.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

| ✅ Module | 🧠 Concept Covered | 📂 Folder Name |
|----------|--------------------|----------------|
| 🔁 Shared State | Share data across nodes | `shared_state` |
| 🔀 Conditional Branching | Route graph based on conditions | `conditional_branching` |
| 🔄 Loop / Retry Logic | Repeat actions until goal met | `loop_retry` |
| 🛠️ Tool Use | Integrate tools like Qdrant | `tool_use` |
| 🧩 Multi-Tool Node | Chain multiple tools in a single node | `multi_tool_node` |
| 🧭 Tool Router | Dynamically choose tool based on query | `dynamic_tool_router` |
| 🧠 Planner → Executor | Build agent loop from plan to execution | `planner_executor` |
| 🔂 Dynamic Executor | Use step-to-tool dispatching inside loop | `agentic_executor` |


Each folder contains:

- `main.py` – runnable code

- `README.md` – explanation of the concept (where applicable)

## 📦 Requirements

Install LangGraph:

pip install langgraph
